# AppointmentBookingSystem
This is an Appointment Booking System application built using Express.js and Firebase. It allows users to register, login, and book appointments. The application provides RESTful API endpoints for managing appointments and ensures that only authenticated users can access them.

**Features**
User registration and login using Firebase Authentication.
JWT token-based authorization for API endpoints.
CRUD operations on appointments:
Create a new appointment.
Retrieve all appointments.
Retrieve a specific appointment by its ID.
Update a specific appointment by its ID.
Delete a specific appointment by its ID.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
Firebase account and project credentials
Postman (or any other API testing tool)

**Getting Started**
**1. Clone the repository:**
git clone <repository-url>
  
**2. Install the dependencies**
cd appointment-booking-system
npm install
  
**3. Set up Firebase:**
Create a Firebase project.
